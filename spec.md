# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display the logged-in user's Internet Identity principal ID prominently on screen so the owner can easily copy it.

**Planned changes:**
- After login, show a banner or header element labeled "Your Internet Identity Principal" displaying the full principal string
- Include a copy-to-clipboard button next to the principal string
- Only show the principal display when the user is authenticated (hidden for anonymous visitors)

**User-visible outcome:** After logging in with Internet Identity, the user sees their full principal ID on screen with a copy button, making it easy to copy and share.
