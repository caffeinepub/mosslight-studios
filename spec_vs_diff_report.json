  "summary": "The diff modifies ProductForm.tsx to add a SKU field with state initialization from existing product data (pre-population), a skuError state for validation, and the field value is tracked via useState. The implementation appears to cover most REQ-1 acceptance criteria based on visible code, though the diff is truncated so some details (validation on submit, inclusion in submitted data) cannot be fully confirmed. The evidence strongly suggests the implementation is largely complete.",
