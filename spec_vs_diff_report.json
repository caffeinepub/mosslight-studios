  "summary": "The diff addresses all three requirements. REQ-1 is handled in ProductForm.tsx where price is stored/transmitted as a plain USD number with no conversion. REQ-2 is handled in CartPage.tsx and MyOrderCard.tsx where totals are calculated as price × quantity in USD with $ symbols and no cents/GBP conversion. REQ-3 is addressed in backend/main.mo where prices are typed as Nat and stored as-is. The implementation appears complete and consistent with the requirements. No hallucinated features were identified.",
